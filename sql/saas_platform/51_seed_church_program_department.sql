-- Church Program (church_programs/church_program_dates, and now Church
-- Calendar on top of it) was built assuming every tenant has a
-- 'church_program' department row -- auto_add_church_program_membership()
-- looks one up by key+tenant_id and silently no-ops if it doesn't
-- exist. But create_tenant_for_signup() (sql/012) never actually
-- seeded one: its department list is exactly DEPARTMENT_KEYS (14
-- entries), which never included 'church_program'. So no tenant --
-- not even this demo one -- has ever had it, and the whole feature has
-- been unreachable (no tab to click) since it was built. Not something
-- today's Church Calendar work broke; it just surfaced the gap.
